# DSA Problems in JavaScript 

Welcome to the **DSA Problems in JavaScript** repository! 🚀 This repository contains various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems implemented in JavaScript.


## 📖 Introduction
This repository is designed to help developers practice and master Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript. It includes solutions to common problems related to arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later recommended)
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vishalmahto0007/dsa-problems.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd dsa-problems
   ```

## 📂 Folder Structure
```
📁 dsa-problems-js
 ┣ 📁 arrays
 ┣ 📁 strings
 ┣ 📁 linked-lists
